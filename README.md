# 🌿 GrowPulse Frontend (WIP)

⚠️ **Status:** This project is currently a **Work in Progress**.  
The main intelligence and functionality live in the **[GrowPulse Backend](https://github.com/mejorandro/growpulse-backend)**.  

---

## 🚧 About This Repo
The **GrowPulse Frontend** will eventually become the clean, minimal UI for browsing role‑aware daily readings generated by the backend.  
It will include filters, summaries, actions, and scannable insights optimized for quick sharing.  

At this stage:
- The repo is **empty/minimal setup only**.  
- Core features are not implemented yet.  
- Development is focused on building and stabilizing the backend first.

## 🔗 Where to Look Instead
👉 Please head over to the backend repository to see the **real engine** of GrowPulse:  

**➡️ [GrowPulse Backend on GitHub](https://github.com/mejorandro/growpulse-backend)**

The backend already includes:
- Agent orchestration with **LangChain + LangGraph**  
- Daily readings pipeline (news → meaning → actions → posts → POC ideas)  
- JSON API ready to be consumed by any frontend  
- Docker support for local or production deployment

## 📌 Note for Visitors
If you’re evaluating this project (e.g., as a hiring manager or collaborator):  
- Please check the **Backend repo** first — that’s where the real logic and momentum live.  
- This frontend will remain minimal until the backend stabilizes.  
- Long‑term goal: a smooth, shareable UI that turns backend outputs into actionable insights.
